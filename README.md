# Tic-Tac-Toe

### Description

I have developed a TicTacToe application using Vue and TypeScript. The game begins by adding two players, and then it's time to start playing! The player who wins receives a point, and you can conveniently keep track of the score. Additionally, if you turn off and then reopen the browser, the game will resume from where you left off, because of localStorage.
